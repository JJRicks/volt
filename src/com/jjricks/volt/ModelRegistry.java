/**
 * Volt's versioned, offline model rules. Each scooter resolves to one layer; each feature then
 * gets one rule (support, reason, evidence, variant, preconditions). Prefix tables record which
 * model IDs the OEM 2.1.9 app treats alike; they are UI policy evidence, not proof of what a
 * controller implements. OEM group rules test only an advertised PID (see DeviceDescriptor).
 *
 * Version 2 maps the UT5 MAX layer, the shared lock, and for identified OEM groups the OEM home
 * screen family (units, range estimate, clock, lights, turn sound, cruise, energy recovery).
 * Version 3 adds the OEM More-screen toggles and choices (traction control, assists, charging,
 * lock time, overspeed control, prompt tone, dual motor, acceleration, PIN and proximity).
 * Version 4 adds the speed family (maximum speed tables, custom speed cap ranges, kick-start
 * speed, group M's on/off energy recovery) with their riding-region rules. Version 5 adds
 * lighting: line/star zones for 2547/2585 (six colours on 2585) and group S's ambient, logo and
 * daytime lights. Ambient lights for other groups stay unmapped. Every
 * other OEM-group key is "not mapped" until its rows are added. OEM-mapped rows are not tested by
 * Volt on those models. BleController and the UI gate every control on these decisions.
 *
 * The guided-test table (testRule: which settings an owner may try once and set back) was
 * developed alongside versions 3-5 as its own version 3; version 6 is the first registry with both
 * the guided-test table and the More-screen, speed and lighting rows. A finished test is
 * report-only evidence; it never enables a control. Version 7 defers regional UI restrictions:
 * each already-mapped model gets the union of its OEM regional choices. Region and visibility
 * flags remain provenance, not capability negotiation; model, firmware and runtime guards remain.
 * Version 11 adds the experimental table (experimentalRule): controls the official app hides for an
 * identified OEM-group model can be tried from Experimental controls; ordinary rules are unchanged.
