"""One-time local NAVEE owner setup. Python 3 + Android platform-tools, no dependencies.

The saved six-byte identity is for Bluetooth ownership authentication, NOT a
NAVEE password, HTTP access token or cloud login token. This helper reads only
fresh OEM "Send authData:" log rows that Android records as written by NAVEE's
own app (its uid for the phone's main user), and never writes full phone logs.
It supports only the main Android user and stops, before changing anything, if
NAVEE is also installed in another user or work profile.

Examples:
  python3 capture-owner.py
  python3 capture-owner.py -s PHONE_SERIAL --output scooter-owner-setup.json --push
  python3 capture-owner.py --capture-log existing-auth-rows.txt --output owner.json

Close other scooter apps before capture. Keep your own scooter nearby, safely
parked and powered on. Enable USB debugging, connect your phone, approve the
computer's debugging prompt, and sign into NAVEE beforehand. The helper briefly
restarts NAVEE so its log setting takes effect. Select your scooter in NAVEE if
it does not reconnect itself. After capture NAVEE closes and its original log
property is restored; open the offline app and import the JSON setup.
