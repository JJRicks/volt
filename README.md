An Android companion for **NAVEE scooters**. Connect over Bluetooth, control your scooter, make the dashboard yours, and explore your rides and battery data. Everyday use works without a Volt account or server.

> [!NOTE]
> **Independent community project.** Volt is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or supported by NAVEE or its app vendor. Product names identify compatible hardware only.

## Make it yours

| Feature | What you get |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔒 **Local controls** | Lock/unlock and supported riding, lighting and charging settings. |
| 🧩 **Your dashboard** | Movable, resizable widgets, quick controls and saved layouts for folded and unfolded screens. |
| 📊 **Live insights** | Searchable readings, charts, favourites and last-seen values. |
| 🗺️ **Ride recordings** | Optional GPS routes, phone sensors, energy readings and complete ride backups. |
| 🔋 **Battery insights** | Optional range learned from your rides, charging estimates and experimental usable ride energy. |

## Install & connect

**You'll need:** Android **8.0+** with Bluetooth LE and an already activated, owner-bound **NAVEE scooter**. Available controls depend on the model; the US UT5 MAX is physically verified, while other models use mappings from the official app. [Compatibility details →](docs/user-guide.md#other-navee-models)

1. **Install Volt.** Download the `.apk` from [Releases](https://github.com/JJRicks/volt/releases/latest), open it on your phone and allow installation when Android asks.
2. **Pair once.** Keep your powered-on scooter nearby and safely parked, and confirm it connects in NAVEE. Follow Volt's recommended [Chrome + USB setup](https://pairscooter.jjricks.com/), or choose another route in the [setup guide](docs/getting-started.md). You can also import an existing setup or full backup.
3. **Connect.** Grant the requested Bluetooth permissions (Location on Android 8–11), close NAVEE to release its connection, and connect in Volt.

First-time capture needs your working NAVEE account and Android debugging access, with your explicit approval. You never enter your NAVEE or Google password into Volt. **After setup, everyday use needs no computer, ADB or Shizuku.**

## Good to know

- **Local by default.** Controls and recording work offline. **Basemap** starts off; the switch below a ride map explains provider access before enabling online tiles and remembers your choice. Existing saved choices are kept. [Privacy →](PRIVACY.md)
- **Keep a backup.** [Back up & restore](docs/user-guide.md#back-up-and-restore) saves an encrypted copy of what you choose, from rides alone to setup, settings, rides and history. Export before clearing app data, and keep backup files private.
- **Estimates have limits.** Range, charging time, usable capacity and phone motion are estimates; reported battery health is not an independent capacity test. [Understanding readings →](docs/recording-reference.md)
